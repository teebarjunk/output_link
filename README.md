# Output Link

Use `out.put("My message")` to print to the console.

Clicking the message in the console will bring you right to the line that called `out.put()`.

- `out.put(arg0, arg1, arg2...)`: Prints everything joined together.
- `out.puts(arg0, arg1, arg2...)`: Prints everything with a space in between.
